ðŸ–§ Tecmicorp Network Configuration

**Description:**
This project was a final project for the Network Basics subject at Tecmilenio College.
The assignment instructions required us to create a network for an imaginary company called "Tecmicorp." We focused on designing one main host and five campuses across the Mexican Republic. Each Tecmicorp campus needed both a physical and logical network structure.

The requirements specified that each location must have at least:

ðŸ”€ 1 Switch	

ðŸ–¥ 1 PC

ðŸ’» 3 Laptops

ðŸ–¥ 1 Server

ðŸ–¨ 1 Printer

I focused on creating a well-structured, visually appealing physical network that is easy to understand while ensuring compliance with all assignment instructions.

All campuses are connected through a router acting as a cloud, which contains the necessary static routes to enable communication between them.
On the logical side, each branch has its own gateway, allowing devices to communicate locally. In the PKT file, you can see labels indicating the IP addresses assigned to all devices. We configured a DNS server on the main server to allow access to the Tecmicorp website, and we also enabled the FTP protocol on the main server.
Regarding the cloud setup, all gateways for each branch are configured, along with the IP addresses of the routers, ensuring that information can travel from the local networks to the entire system. We implemented PORT SECURITY to block unused switch ports, enhancing network security. Any unused ports remain disabled to prevent unauthorized access to our subnets. All these configurations were included in the Tecmicorp network, making it a scalable, secure, and adaptable model for a real business. The network design was entirely based on real-world hypothetical scenarios.

**How to use this project:**

-You need to ensure that Cisco Packet Tracer is installed and download the PKT file from this repository.

-Then, open Cisco Packet Tracer, and on the left side, you will find the "File" button. Click on it, then select "Open".

-Next, locate the PKT file you just downloaded and open it. Now, you should see the network loaded in Cisco Packet Tracer

Enjoy!
